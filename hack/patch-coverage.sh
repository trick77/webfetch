#
# Patch coverage: the lines this branch adds or changes must be at least
# PATCH_MIN% covered. Complements hack/coverage-gate.sh, which enforces the
# absolute project floor — the two answer different questions:
#
#   coverage-gate.sh   "is the codebase as a whole tested enough?"   (75% floor)
#   patch-coverage.sh  "is the code I just wrote tested?"            (80% patch)
#
# The floor alone lets a large well-tested codebase absorb untested new code
# without ever going red. The patch gate alone lets legacy debt sit forever.
# Both, together, pin the gain without punishing anyone for debt they inherited.
#
# Ported from loom, which has run this since its early days.
#
# Coverage reports must already exist — CI produces them before calling this.
